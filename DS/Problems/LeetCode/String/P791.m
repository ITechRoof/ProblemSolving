//https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/
//S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.
//
//S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.
//
//Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.
//
//Example :
//Input:
//S = "cba"
//T = "abcd"
//Output: "cbad"
//Explanation:
//"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
//Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
//
//
//Note:
//
//S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
//T has length at most 200.
//S and T consist of lowercase letters only.
