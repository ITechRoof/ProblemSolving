//https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-decreasing-string/
//Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:
//
//Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
//Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
//Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
//Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
//Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
//Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
//Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
//In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.
//
//Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
//Output: "abccbaabccba"
//Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
//After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
//First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
//After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
//After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
//Example 2:
//
//Input: s = "rat"
//Output: "art"
//Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
//Example 3:
//
//Input: s = "leetcode"
//Output: "cdelotee"
//Example 4:
//
//Input: s = "ggggggg"
//Output: "ggggggg"
//Example 5:
//
//Input: s = "spo"
//Output: "ops"
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= s.length <= 500
//s contains only lower-case English letters.
