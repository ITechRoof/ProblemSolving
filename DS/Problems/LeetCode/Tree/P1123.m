//https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/
//Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
//
//Recall that:
//
//The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
//The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d+1.
//The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: root = [1,2,3]
//Output: [1,2,3]
//Explanation:
//The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
//The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
//The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
//Example 2:
//
//Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
//Output: [4]
//Example 3:
//
//Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
//Output: [2,4,5]
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
//Each node of the tree will have a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
